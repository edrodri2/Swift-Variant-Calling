Implementation notes:

-The Swift/T branch would accept empty inputs in the runfile, i.e. scenarios like:
 SOMETHING=
 Swift/K does not, and an error will be generated instantanously. Which behaviour is better depneds: for example, the user may have a complete template and then he chooses to fill in some fields and keeps the rest empty, so that he maintains the structure of the runfile always.
 However, this means that there exists a need to check if the user misses out on something that is critical!  This is true of both programs and parameters to various tools (check the paths provided are correct, and something is there!)

- Another issue that you need to pay attention to is how permissions are given to users on the files created by the pipeline. It is desirable for the user to rwx, group to r, and others none; i.e., 740

- Also, how do you delete existing files and folders? (it would be desirable to start fresh at times and absolutely delete the entire pre-existing files and folders) ==> Actually, the code does NOT support resuming a partially executed run, and produces errors when run on a folder that already contains resultsl

- Consider how logging of runs and reporting is managed here!

- as for the sampleinfo file, if it is misformatted, an error will be generated, but it will not be clear why the error has occured! Need to add code to check that each line is formatted as <sample> <r1> <r2>. 

- The following tools need to be more flexible:
-- samtools view: sometimes, it converts sam to bam. At others, it counts the number of alignments 

- Templates for tcl leaf functions can be found in: /usr/local/src/swift-t-0.9.1/turbine/code/scripts/main-wrap/templates========== /usr/local/src/swift-t-0.9.1/turbine/scripts/main-wrap/templates

- To know all built-in functions in swift/t, please refer to the directory: /usr/local/src/swift-t-0.9.1/turbine/export   (which is the installation folder)

- In its current form, the alignment is done to the entire sample at once. Does it make sense to still "merge the bams"?
